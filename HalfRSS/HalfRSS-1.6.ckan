    "abstract": "HalfRSS is a mod that uses the great work from NathanKell and creates our Real Solar System in a smaller scale in KSP. At half the size of the RSS, HalfRSS is still 5 times larger than stock KSP and provides a huge challenge to players, but can be achieved with stock parts. I always loved the idea of playing in our Real Solar System, but I am not a good enough player to be able to accomplish that on the grand RSS scale.",
